# Easi-ML
Someone are struggling with highly specialized machine learning concepts and tool-kits, while someone are giving up at the first glance of complicated programming language. 

Some leading engineers try to build up Auto-ML systems, where models are trained and tuned all by themselves. 

However, it is really a pity for anyone insterested in bringing up his/her own baby models. 

Please remind that we still enjoy making Lego even if the civil engineering has incredibly higly develped. 

Please remind that we still enjoy grilling chicken wings even if you can order any dish via a simple phone call. 

We call it ART, but not PROJECT. 

Easi-ML extracts common used components from popular tool kits to help non-knowledge users as building bricks for your machine learning arts.

Easi-ML highly reduce your programming efforts for who have no sense of computer science: students, mathematician, self business owners, emerging business explorers, ML true lovers.
